#  This is my first code in github! QUite exciting, right?
 
# Here are the input data
# Costanza data on streams
water <- c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500)
water
 
# Marta data on fishes genomes
fishes <- c(10, 50, 60, 100, 200)
fishes
 
# plot the diversity of fishes (y) versus the amount of water (x)
# a funtcion is used with arguments inside! 
plot(water, fishes)

# the data we developed can be stored in atable
# a table in R is called data frame

streams <- data.frame (water, fishes)
